			<p>
			<b>Significance to students:</b>
			This project not only helps the partner institution, but also us the students. Though not directly the students gain benefits 
			like experience and values. We are able to gain experience in helping those who are struggling in big ways. Instead of providing
			money that can last a few days we provide ways to help them gain the money needed which can last them indefinitely. We gained 
			important values and lessons that are beneficial for our future. Being able to find solutions for problems that are common,
			can help us be successful in life. Learning the value of generosity and how we can help those who are struggling without the 
			need for a reward helps us grow closer to being a better version of ourselves. We may not be able to gain something concrete
			but these values and experiences are what is needed in our lives. <br> <br>

			<b>Significance to institution:</b>
			Zen project was created specifically to address the needs of our partner institution SMAC. Here we give them a substantial,
			sustainable, and long-term source of money to continue to run the foundation. We achieve this through the profit gained from 
			selling plants and vegetables. Moreover, we empower them to become self-sustaining producers by giving them a business that 
			well help cover their expenses without having to rely on a external factor that may come and go over time. <br> <br>
			 
			<b>Significance to General Public:</b>
			The project is important to the general public for one major and crucial reason.
			This being the motivation to help those in need. When we take initiative to start a source of income, we are showing the 
			public that this is a real problem that real people are facing on a daily basis. We are illustrating the struggles of the
			foundation in trying to provide enough for the children in SMAC. This will be utilized as a wake up call to encourage people 
			to donate to the foundation, buy local products from them, be a sponsor, and more. Essentially we are taking the first step 
			and therefore encouraging others to acknowledge the issue and do the same.<br> <br>
			 </p>

	<h1 align="center">Problem Identification</h1>
		<p align="left">    
			The SMAC Institution has a scarcity regarding its funds as they heavily rely on their sponsors
			and benefactors. Because of that, thereâ€™s a limit to the support the SMAC Institution can give
			to the children they take in. This is explicitly stated in the interview with the head of the institution, Sister Luzviminda
			Pepito, wherein she tells us about how 9 out of the 10 children missed out on having a psychological assessment due to
			lack of funding. She also states that funds allocated for a certain material cannot be used to pay for something else. 
			For example money meant to pay for food cannot be transferred and used to pay for the electric bill, etc. <br><br><br>
	<h1 align="center">Problem Intervention</h1><br>
		<p>
		Upon knowing the problem the SMAC Institution is facing, we came down to the solution of Project Zen. This project aims to establish
		a business that will serve as a permanent source of income for the foundation and it has three 
		main stages. First is the pre-implementation stage in which we draft, gather, and evaluate all needed resources and materials.
		Second, is the implementation stage where we will have two main phases. Phase one is the development of the most high quality
		compost that we can create using our SIP. Phase two is the business start-up phase where we begin the business and sell the plants and 
		vegetables grown from the compost we made. Last is the post-implementation phase where we will evaluate the outcomes of our project. 
		We will see how much profit the business generated, the strength, and weaknesses of the project, and what improvements should we make. 
		All the profit gained from this project will go to the school supplies and clothes of the children under SMAC. 
		The main goal of the project is to improve the preparedness of people to respond to floods through evacuation measures in order to reduce the flooding disaster losses.
		<br><br>
		<b>OBJECTIVES:</b><br><br>
		The main goal of the project is to improve the living conditions of the SMAC foundation through the money generated. <br><br>
		The specific objectives of the project include:<br><br>
		1. To grow healthy plants and vegetables for the sisters to sell.<br><br>
		2. Successfully develop and create a business that sells plants and vegetables. <br><br>
		3. To earn enough income from the sold plants. <br><br>
